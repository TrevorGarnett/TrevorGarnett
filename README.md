- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TrevorGarnett
In May 2024, I will obtain a master's in computer science. I have several passion projects I am working on right now, including PumpPals â€“ an upcoming cross-platform mobile app. Feel free to check out my progress on that application [https://github.com/TrevorGarnett/PumpPal](url) and a remodel of my personal website.

I am currently looking for an entry level job. Currently, I am open to any sector of computer science : web dev (frontend/backend), mobile, data science, etc. However, longterm, I aspire to involve math in my career (e.g., cryptography, machine learing, data science). With my background in both math and computer science from my undergrad, and my graduate level research in High Performance Computing (HPC), I believe my background has aptly prepared me for these kinds of roles.
